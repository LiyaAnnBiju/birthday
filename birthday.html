Happy Birthday.

Today is not about distance.
Not about time zones.
Not about how many years have passed.

Today is simply about you.

About the courage it takes to step into unfamiliar spaces and still stand steady.
Another year older — but more importantly, another year braver.

Over the years, so many things have changed — schools, cities, countries, responsibilities.

But through all of it, you have been the one constant while everything else shifted.

Distance changed our location.
It never changed our equation.

I admire the way you handle change with quiet determination.
The way you show up for the people you care about.
The way you continue growing without losing who you are.

I hope this year feels lighter.
I hope you trust your own strength more.
And I hope you achieve things that once felt slightly out of reach.

You deserve a year that matches your effort.

Happy Birthday.
To growth.
To courage.
To you.

Through every version of life, this remained.
Different maps. Same meaning.
Still here. Always.

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">
One thing I want you to know.
</span>
You once did something for me that meant more than you probably realised.

It wasn’t just the gesture.
It was the thought.
The effort.
The intention behind it.

I’ve carried that with me ever since.

Thank you — for showing up the way you do.
For being steady.
For being you.

Keep building.
Keep believing.
Keep becoming.

No matter the country.
No matter the time zone.

I’m always in your corner.

Happy Birthday 🤍

May this year meet you with the same care you give to others.

Some constants are rare. I’m grateful ours is one of them.
